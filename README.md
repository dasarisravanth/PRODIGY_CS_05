**For my final task as an intern at Prodigy Info Tech:-**

I developed a network packet analyzer. This tool captures and analyzes network packets, 
displaying relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. The tool ensures ethical use for educational purposes.

**Features:-**

- The program captures data packets from the internet, loads data into packets, and transfers them layer by layer using a sniffing algorithm.
- It supports multiple protocols, including TCP, UDP, and ARP.
- The program imports IP address libraries and reverses IP addresses of the source and destination.

**Output:-**

- After transferring packets, the program displays the source and destination IP addresses, protocol used, packets transferred, and payload data.
